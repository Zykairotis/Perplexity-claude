## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zykairotis/Perplexity-claude.git
cd Perplexity-claude
```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure environment variables**
```bash
cp .example.env .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

5. **Set up authentication**

Extract your Perplexity cookies and save them to `cookies.json`:

### 🍪 How to Get Cookies

#### Perplexity (to use your own account)
* Open [Perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai/) and login.
* Click `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` to open inspector.
* Go to the "Network" tab in the inspector.
* Refresh the page, right-click the first request, hover on "Copy" and click "Copy as cURL (bash)".
* Now go to the [CurlConverter](https://curlconverter.com/python/) and paste your code here. The cookies dictionary will appear, copy and use it in your codes.

#### Emailnator (for account generating)
* Open [Emailnator](https://emailnator.com/) and verify you're human.
* Click `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` to open inspector.
* Go to the "Network" tab in the inspector.
* Refresh the page, right-click the first request, hover on "Copy" and click "Copy as cURL (bash)".
* Now go to the [CurlConverter](https://curlconverter.com/python/) and paste your code here. The cookies dictionary will appear, copy and use it in your codes.
* Cookies for Emailnator are temporary, you need to renew them continuously.

**Save cookies to `cookies.json`:**
```json
{
  "cookies": {
    "pplx.visitor-id": "your-visitor-id",
    "pplx.session-id": "your-session-id",
    "next-auth.csrf-token": "your-csrf-token",
    "__Secure-next-auth.session-token": "your-session-token",
    "pplx.search-models-v4": "{\"research\":\"pplx_alpha\",\"search\":\"experimental\",\"studio\":\"pplx_beta\"}"
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- Never commit `cookies.json` to version control
- Cookies expire and need to be refreshed periodically
- The `pplx.search-models-v4` setting controls which models are available to your account

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Perplexity API Configuration
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Server Configuration
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000

# MCP Server Settings
MCP_SERVER_NAME=perplexity-mcp
MCP_SERVER_VERSION=0.1.0

# LiteLLM Configuration (optional)
LITELLM_PROXY_PORT=4000
```

## 💻 Usage

### 1. Running the MCP Server

Start the main MCP server:

```bash
python -m src.perplexity_mcp_server.server
```

Or use the modular version:

```bash
python src/perplexity_mcp_main.py
```

### 2. CLI Chat Interface

Launch the interactive chat interface:

```bash
python src/chat_cli.py
```

### 3. Using with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "src.perplexity_mcp_server.server"
      ],
      "cwd": "/path/to/Perplexity-claude"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Using the API Server

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
python src/server.py
```

Access the API at `http://localhost:8000` and view documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 5. LiteLLM Proxy

Run the LiteLLM proxy for unified LLM access:

```bash
python src/litellm_proxy.py
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and start services
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Restart with latest changes
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build
```

**📝 Note:** If you have a `cookies.json` file, the Docker setup will automatically mount it. Make sure it's in the project root directory.

### Using Docker Directly

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t perplexity-mcp .

# Run container
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/cookies.json:/app/cookies.json:ro \
  --name perplexity-mcp \
  perplexity-mcp
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Ensure you're in the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Issue: "Authentication failed"**
- Verify your `cookies.json` file is correctly formatted
- Ensure cookies are not expired
- Re-extract cookies from your browser
- Check that `pplx.search-models-v4` cookie includes the models you want to use

**Issue: "Model not found" errors**
- The `sonar` model has been renamed to `experimental`
- Update your code to use `experimental` instead of `sonar`
- Check your `pplx.search-models-v4` cookie setting to ensure the model is available

**Issue: Docker containers can't find cookies**
- Make sure `cookies.json` is in the project root directory
- Copy cookies to running container: `docker cp cookies.json perplexity-claude-perplexity-server-1:/app/`
- Restart containers with: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build`

**Issue: "Port already in use"**
```bash
# Find and kill process using the port
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```
