Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance at tasks without being explicitly programmed for each step. Simply put, ML finds hidden patterns in data and uses them to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\\n\\nML works by feeding algorithms lots of examples (called training data), so they can identify mathematical relationships between inputs and outputs. After training, the model can predict or classify new data based on what it has learned.\\n\\nThere are several types of machine learning, including:\\n\\n- **Supervised learning**: Learning from labeled data to predict outcomes.\\n- **Unsupervised learning**: Finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data.\\n- **Reinforcement learning**: Learning to make decisions via trial and error to maximize rewards.\\n\\nBefore diving deeper, I\\u2019d love to know: What\\u2019s your current experience with machine learning?
