  "query": "Explain quantum computing simply",
  "answer": "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses principles from quantum physics to solve problems that classical computers find very hard or impossible. Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, quantum bits called *qubits* can be in multiple states at once, thanks to a property called *superposition*. Another key principle is *entanglement*, where qubits become linked so that the state of one instantly influences the other, no matter the distance. These features let quantum computers perform many calculations simultaneously, potentially making them much faster for certain tasks.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let me ask: how familiar are you with these ideas already? This will help me explain the concepts at the right level.",

This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information at once. Qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This correlation can be used to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Quantum computers could break widely used encryption methods (like RSA) due to their ability to factor large numbers quickly. This has led to the development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. They can simulate molecular interactions at a quantum level, significantly speeding up the drug discovery process by predicting how different compounds will behave.

                "description": "Quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers can't. They rely on qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for more complex computations and parallel processing. Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition). This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information at once. Qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This correlation can be used to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Quantum computers could break widely used encryption methods (like RSA) due to their ability to factor large numbers quickly. This has led to the development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. They can simulate molecular interactions at a quantum level, significantly speeding up the drug discovery process by predicting how different compounds will behave. In this video, we have explained quantum computing in simple words and explained how quantum computers work.\n\n#QuantumComputing #FutureOfTech #QuantumSupremacy\n\nVideo link:\n\nQuantum entanglement explained: https://youtu.be/fkAAbXPEAtU?si=l5jUh0cCxj6jXDfE\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01692-9\nhttps://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/googles-claims-quantum-supremacy-groundbreaking-overhyped-or-both\nhttps://news.ucsb.edu/2019/019682/achieving-quantum-supremacy\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quantum-computing-what-leaders-need-to-know-now\n\nIf you wish to buy/license this video, please write to us at admin@scienceabc.com.\n\nVoice Over Artist: John Staughton ( https://www.fiverr.com/jswildwood )\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \n\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com",

Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, quantum bits called *qubits* can be in multiple states at once, thanks to a property called *superposition*. Another key principle is *entanglement*, where qubits become linked so that the state of one instantly influences the other, no matter the distance. These features let quantum computers perform many calculations simultaneously, potentially making them much faster for certain tasks.\\n\\nBefore we dive deeper, let me ask: how familiar are you with these ideas already?

Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition). This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information at once. Qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This correlation can be used to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Quantum computers could break widely used encryption methods (like RSA) due to their ability to factor large numbers quickly. This has led to the development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. They can simulate molecular interactions at a quantum level, significantly speeding up the drug discovery process by predicting how different compounds will behave. In this video, we have explained quantum computing in simple words and explained how quantum computers work.\\n\\n#QuantumComputing #FutureOfTech #QuantumSupremacy\\n\\nVideo link:\\n\\nQuantum entanglement explained: https://youtu.be/fkAAbXPEAtU?si=l5jUh0cCxj6jXDfE\\n\\nReferences:\\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01692-9\\nhttps://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/googles-claims-quantum-supremacy-groundbreaking-overhyped-or-both\\nhttps://news.ucsb.edu/2019/019682/achieving-quantum-supremacy\\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quantum-computing-what-leaders-need-to-know-now\\n\\nIf you wish to buy/license this video, please write to us at admin@scienceabc.com.\\n\\nVoice Over Artist: John Staughton ( https://www.fiverr.com/jswildwood )\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter! \\nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\\n\\nFollow us on Facebook!\\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\\n\\nFollow us on Instagram!\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \\n\\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\\n\\nFollow our Website!\\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com\", \"images\": [], \"published_date\": \"2024-09-23T00:00:00\"}, \"file_metadata\": null, \"is_attachment\": false, \"is_image\": false, \"is_code_interpreter\": false, \"is_knowledge_card\": false, \"is_navigational\": false, \"is_widget\": false, \"sitelinks\": null, \"is_focused_web\": false, \"is_client_context\": false, \"inline_entity_id\": null, \"is_memory\": false, \"is_conversation_history\": false, \"tab_id\": null, \"is_scrubbed\": null}, {\"name\": \"What Is Quantum Computing?

                      "description": "Quantum computers use the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers can't. They rely on qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for more complex computations and parallel processing. Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition). This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information at once. Qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This correlation can be used to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Quantum computers could break widely used encryption methods (like RSA) due to their ability to factor large numbers quickly. This has led to the development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. They can simulate molecular interactions at a quantum level, significantly speeding up the drug discovery process by predicting how different compounds will behave. In this video, we have explained quantum computing in simple words and explained how quantum computers work.\n\n#QuantumComputing #FutureOfTech #QuantumSupremacy\n\nVideo link:\n\nQuantum entanglement explained: https://youtu.be/fkAAbXPEAtU?si=l5jUh0cCxj6jXDfE\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01692-9\nhttps://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/googles-claims-quantum-supremacy-groundbreaking-overhyped-or-both\nhttps://news.ucsb.edu/2019/019682/achieving-quantum-supremacy\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quantum-computing-what-leaders-need-to-know-now\n\nIf you wish to buy/license this video, please write to us at admin@scienceabc.com.\n\nVoice Over Artist: John Staughton ( https://www.fiverr.com/jswildwood )\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \n\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com",

Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, qubits can be in a state of 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition). This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information at once. Qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. This correlation can be used to perform complex calculations more efficiently. Quantum computers could break widely used encryption methods (like RSA) due to their ability to factor large numbers quickly. This has led to the development of quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. They can simulate molecular interactions at a quantum level, significantly speeding up the drug discovery process by predicting how different compounds will behave. In this video, we have explained quantum computing in simple words and explained how quantum computers work.\n\n#QuantumComputing #FutureOfTech #QuantumSupremacy\n\nVideo link:\n\nQuantum entanglement explained: https://youtu.be/fkAAbXPEAtU?si=l5jUh0cCxj6jXDfE\n\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01692-9\nhttps://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/googles-claims-quantum-supremacy-groundbreaking-overhyped-or-both\nhttps://news.ucsb.edu/2019/019682/achieving-quantum-supremacy\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/quantum-computing-what-leaders-need-to-know-now\n\nIf you wish to buy/license this video, please write to us at admin@scienceabc.com.\n\nVoice Over Artist: John Staughton ( https://www.fiverr.com/jswildwood )\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get more such science videos! \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcN3IuIAR6Fn74FWMQf6lFA?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \nhttps://twitter.com/abc_science\n\nFollow us on Facebook!\nhttps://facebook.com/sciabc\n\nFollow us on Instagram!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/scienceabcofficial/ \n\nFollow us on LinkedIn!\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/scienceabc\n\nFollow our Website!\nhttps://www.scienceabc.com",
