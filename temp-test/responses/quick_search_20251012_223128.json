  "answer": "Async/await in Python are keywords used for asynchronous programming, allowing the execution of code to pause and resume without blocking other operations. \n\n- The `async` keyword is used to define asynchronous functions (coroutines), which can be paused and resumed, enabling concurrent execution of tasks.\n- The `await` keyword is used inside an `async` function to pause its execution until the awaited asynchronous operation is completed, allowing other tasks to run in the meantime.\n\nTogether, they enable writing non-blocking, concurrent code, which is especially useful for I/O-bound tasks like network requests or file operations. For example, `await asyncio.sleep(1)` pauses the coroutine for 1 second without blocking the entire program, allowing other async tasks to run concurrently. Async/await relies on Python's `asyncio` library for managing the asynchronous event loop and task scheduling.\n\nThis approach improves performance in programs where waiting for external operations would otherwise block the execution flow, resulting in faster and more responsive applications. Async functions need to be awaited to run properly, and only `async def` functions can use `await`.\n\nHence, async/await in Python provide a clean, readable way to write asynchronous code using coroutines, improving concurrency and efficiency without complex threading.[1][2][3][4][5]",
