  "answer": "Here is a detailed summary of the most recent information on the impacts of climate change from multiple reliable sources in 2025:\n\n### Environmental Impacts\n- Global warming continues to drive significant environmental changes including biodiversity loss, shifts in ecosystems, and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, and intense rainfall. Melting ice caps and rising sea levels threaten coastal areas and ecosystems, causing habitat loss and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. Arctic warming is predicted to be more than three and a half times the global average, severely reducing sea ice. Oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, reducing oxygen levels and expanding dead zones.[1][2][3][4][10]\n\n### Economic Impacts\n- Climate change is projected to seriously disrupt economies, especially agriculture and food security. Changes in temperature and rain patterns reduce crop and livestock productivity leading to food shortages and higher prices. Natural disasters related to climate change cause widespread economic losses, damaging infrastructure and disrupting global trade and supply chains. These effects disproportionately impact vulnerable communities and developing countries.[2][1]\n\n### Social and Health Impacts\n- Climate change worsens health outcomes by increasing heatwaves, worsening air and water quality, expanding the spread of disease, and intensifying extreme weather events. It contributes directly to humanitarian crises like heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and hurricanes, which are growing in frequency and intensity. The WHO estimates 3.6 billion people live in areas highly susceptible to climate impacts, with an expected 250,000 additional deaths per year from related causes by 2030. Climate change also threatens health systems and infrastructure, especially in less developed regions.[6][1][2]\n\n### Climate Projections and Trends\n- The likelihood of global average temperature exceeding 1.5°C over the 2025-2029 period is now at 70%, up from previous years. This sustained warming drives more severe heatwaves, droughts, floods, and ice melt, worsening risks. Precipitation changes will continue to create wetter conditions in some regions like northern Europe and northern Siberia, while others like the Amazon will face drier seasons. The Arctic is expected to experience dramatic warming, accelerating ice loss.[3]\n\n### Policy and Mitigation\n- Mitigation strategies emphasizing renewable energy solutions are critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change impacts. Efforts include transitioning from fossil fuels to wind, solar, hydropower, and nuclear energy, improving energy conservation, and developing climate-resilient infrastructure. Social policies to address climate migration, food insecurity, and economic instability are increasingly necessary.[4][1]\n\nThis comprehensive view from recent 2025 data points to urgent and multifaceted impacts of climate change on the environment, economies, societies, and health worldwide, underscoring the importance of aggressive mitigation and adaptation efforts.[1][2][3][4][6]\n\nIf more focus on any specific impact or mitigation strategy is desired, further detailed exploration is available.",

          "answer": "{\"answer\": \"Here is a detailed summary of the most recent information on the impacts of climate change from multiple reliable sources in 2025:\\n\\n### Environmental Impacts\\n- Global warming continues to drive significant environmental changes including biodiversity loss, shifts in ecosystems, and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, and intense rainfall. Melting ice caps and rising sea levels threaten coastal areas and ecosystems, causing habitat loss and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. Arctic warming is predicted to be more than three and a half times the global average, severely reducing sea ice. Oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, reducing oxygen levels and expanding dead zones.[1][2][3][4][10]\\n\\n### Economic Impacts\\n- Climate change is projected to seriously disrupt economies, especially agriculture and food security. Changes in temperature and rain patterns reduce crop and livestock productivity leading to food shortages and higher prices. Natural disasters related to climate change cause widespread economic losses, damaging infrastructure and disrupting global trade and supply chains. These effects disproportionately impact vulnerable communities and developing countries.[2][1]\\n\\n### Social and Health Impacts\\n- Climate change worsens health outcomes by increasing heatwaves, worsening air and water quality, expanding the spread of disease, and intensifying extreme weather events. It contributes directly to humanitarian crises like heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and hurricanes, which are growing in frequency and intensity. The WHO estimates 3.6 billion people live in areas highly susceptible to climate impacts, with an expected 250,000 additional deaths per year from related causes by 2030. Climate change also threatens health systems and infrastructure, especially in less developed regions.[6][1][2]\\n\\n### Climate Projections and Trends\\n- The likelihood of global average temperature exceeding 1.5\\u00b0C over the 2025-2029 period is now at 70%, up from previous years. This sustained warming drives more severe heatwaves, droughts, floods, and ice melt, worsening risks. Precipitation changes will continue to create wetter conditions in some regions like northern Europe and northern Siberia, while others like the Amazon will face drier seasons. The Arctic is expected to experience dramatic warming, accelerating ice loss.[3]\\n\\n### Policy and Mitigation\\n- Mitigation strategies emphasizing renewable energy solutions are critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change impacts. Efforts include transitioning from fossil fuels to wind, solar, hydropower, and nuclear energy, improving energy conservation, and developing climate-resilient infrastructure. Social policies to address climate migration, food insecurity, and economic instability are increasingly necessary.[4][1]\\n\\nThis comprehensive view from recent 2025 data points to urgent and multifaceted impacts of climate change on the environment, economies, societies, and health worldwide, underscoring the importance of aggressive mitigation and adaptation efforts.[1][2][3][4][6]\\n\\nIf more focus on any specific impact or mitigation strategy is desired, further detailed exploration is available.\", \"web_results\": [{\"name\": \"Explore the Surprising Global Warming Effects in 2025\", \"snippet\": \"Discover the surprising global warming effects expected in 2025 in this comprehensive case study.\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-07-05T00:00:00\", \"url\": \"https://protectearth.foundation/explore-the-surprising-global-warming-effects-in-2025/\", \"meta_data\": {\"client\": \"web\", \"date\": null, \"citation_domain_name\": \"protectearth\", \"suffix\": \"foundation\", \"domain_name\": \"Protect Earth Foundation\", \"description\": \"Discover the surprising global warming effects expected in 2025 in this comprehensive case study.\", \"images\": [\"https://protectearth.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/global-warming-effects-2025.jpg\"], \"published_date\": \"2025-07-05T00:00:00\"}, \"file_metadata\": null, \"is_attachment\": false, \"is_image\": false, \"is_code_interpreter\": false, \"is_knowledge_card\": false, \"is_navigational\": false, \"is_widget\": false, \"sitelinks\": null, \"is_focused_web\": false, \"is_client_context\": false, \"inline_entity_id\": null, \"is_memory\": false, \"is_conversation_history\": false, \"tab_id\": null, \"is_scrubbed\": null}, {\"name\": \"Impacts of Climate Change | US EPA\", \"snippet\": \"Climate change impacts our health, environment, and economy.\", \"timestamp\": \"2025-08-22T00:00:00\", \"url\": \"https://www.epa.gov/climatechange-science/impacts-climate-change\", \"meta_data\": {\"client\": \"web\", \"date\": null, \"citation_domain_name\": \"epa\", \"suffix\": \"gov\", \"domain_name\": \"US EPA\", \"description\": \"Climate change impacts our health, environment, and economy.\", \"images\": [\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/images/2022-03/epa-standard-twitter.jpg\"], \"published_date\": \"2025-08-22T00:00:00\"}, \"file_metadata\": null, \"is_attachment\": false, \"is_image\": false, \"is_code_interpreter\": false, \"is_knowledge_card\": false, \"is_navigational\": false, \"is_widget\": false, \"sitelinks\": null, \"is_focused_web\": false, \"is_client_context\": false, \"inline_entity_id\": null, \"is_memory\": false, \"is_conversation_history\": false, \"tab_id\": null, \"is_scrubbed\": null}, {\"name\": \"Global climate predictions show temperatures expected to ...\", \"snippet\": \"There is a forecast 70% chance that the five-year average warming for 2025-2029 will be more than 1.5\\u00b0C, according to the report.

          "answer": "Here is a detailed summary of the most recent information on the impacts of climate change from multiple reliable sources in 2025:\n\n### Environmental Impacts\n- Global warming continues to drive significant environmental changes including biodiversity loss, shifts in ecosystems, and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, and intense rainfall. Melting ice caps and rising sea levels threaten coastal areas and ecosystems, causing habitat loss and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. Arctic warming is predicted to be more than three and a half times the global average, severely reducing sea ice. Oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, reducing oxygen levels and expanding dead zones.[1][2][3][4][10]\n\n### Economic Impacts\n- Climate change is projected to seriously disrupt economies, especially agriculture and food security. Changes in temperature and rain patterns reduce crop and livestock productivity leading to food shortages and higher prices. Natural disasters related to climate change cause widespread economic losses, damaging infrastructure and disrupting global trade and supply chains. These effects disproportionately impact vulnerable communities and developing countries.[2][1]\n\n### Social and Health Impacts\n- Climate change worsens health outcomes by increasing heatwaves, worsening air and water quality, expanding the spread of disease, and intensifying extreme weather events. It contributes directly to humanitarian crises like heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and hurricanes, which are growing in frequency and intensity. The WHO estimates 3.6 billion people live in areas highly susceptible to climate impacts, with an expected 250,000 additional deaths per year from related causes by 2030. Climate change also threatens health systems and infrastructure, especially in less developed regions.[6][1][2]\n\n### Climate Projections and Trends\n- The likelihood of global average temperature exceeding 1.5°C over the 2025-2029 period is now at 70%, up from previous years. This sustained warming drives more severe heatwaves, droughts, floods, and ice melt, worsening risks. Precipitation changes will continue to create wetter conditions in some regions like northern Europe and northern Siberia, while others like the Amazon will face drier seasons. The Arctic is expected to experience dramatic warming, accelerating ice loss.[3]\n\n### Policy and Mitigation\n- Mitigation strategies emphasizing renewable energy solutions are critical to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change impacts. Efforts include transitioning from fossil fuels to wind, solar, hydropower, and nuclear energy, improving energy conservation, and developing climate-resilient infrastructure. Social policies to address climate migration, food insecurity, and economic instability are increasingly necessary.[4][1]\n\nThis comprehensive view from recent 2025 data points to urgent and multifaceted impacts of climate change on the environment, economies, societies, and health worldwide, underscoring the importance of aggressive mitigation and adaptation efforts.[1][2][3][4][6]\n\nIf more focus on any specific impact or mitigation strategy is desired, further detailed exploration is available."
