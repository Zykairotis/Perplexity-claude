              "snippet": "As software engineering progresses and the demand for code increases, code clones have become more prevalent. Vulnerability propagation is one of the risks posed by this phenomenon, which highlights the increasing significance of code clone detection techniques. It is a highly prevalent method of source code reuse and duplication in source code development. When a bug is detected in a specific snippet of code, it becomes necessary to examine all similar snippets for the presence of the same bug. As a result, this replication procedure may result in the propagation of bugs, which has a substantial impact on maintenance expenses. Owing to this, Code Clone Detection (CCD) emerges as a dynamic field of study. As a result, there is an urgent requirement to examine the most recent methodologies and developments within the field of CCD. In this paper we exhaustively examine the most recent techniques employed in the identification of clones in source code using Machine Learning. The field of Machine learning (ML) has become a preferred approach in the field Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Deep Learning in the field ML, for the development of practical software in numerous fields; detection of source code clones as in our case of study.",

              "snippet": "In recent years, Artificial Intelligence technology has excelled in various applications across all domains and fields. However, the various algorithms in neural networks make it difficult to understand the reasons behind decisions. For this reason, trustworthy AI techniques have started gaining popularity. The concept of trustworthiness is cross-disciplinary; it must meet societal standards and principles, and technology is used to fulfill these requirements. In this paper, we first surveyed developments from various countries and regions on the ethical elements that make AI algorithms trustworthy; and then focused our survey on the state of the art research into the interpretability of AI. We have conducted an intensive survey on technologies and techniques used in making AI explainable. Finally, we identified new trends in achieving explainable AI. In particular, we elaborate on the strong link between the explainability of AI and the meta-reasoning of autonomous systems. The concept of meta-reasoning is 'reason the reasoning', which coincides with the intention and goal of explainable Al. The integration of the approaches could pave the way for future interpretable AI systems.",

Vulnerability propagation is one of the risks posed by this phenomenon, which highlights the increasing significance of code clone detection techniques. It is a highly prevalent method of source code reuse and duplication in source code development. When a bug is detected in a specific snippet of code, it becomes necessary to examine all similar snippets for the presence of the same bug. As a result, this replication procedure may result in the propagation of bugs, which has a substantial impact on maintenance expenses. Owing to this, Code Clone Detection (CCD) emerges as a dynamic field of study. As a result, there is an urgent requirement to examine the most recent methodologies and developments within the field of CCD. In this paper we exhaustively examine the most recent techniques employed in the identification of clones in source code using Machine Learning. The field of Machine learning (ML) has become a preferred approach in the field Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Deep Learning in the field ML, for the development of practical software in numerous fields; detection of source code clones as in our case of study.",
